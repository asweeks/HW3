# HW3
1. The blades of grass are drawn by the line function on line 12
2. The lawnmower comes by at random intervals. The if statement on line 21 uses the random function and a conditional statement to randomly fill over the grass.
3. The h variable keeps track of the height of the grass. Once the grass has grown all the way accross the screen the h is increased so the next row if grass wil become taller.
4. The height-10 sets the base point of the coordinate on the "dirt" and the random(h) gives the grass a random height between 0 and the current h value
